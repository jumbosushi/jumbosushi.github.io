Hello hello

My name is Atsushi, and I'm a 3rd year Business and Computer Science student at University of British Columbia.

I've interned at [BlackBerry](https://ca.blackberry.com/) and at [Prynt](https://www.prynt.co/) in the past.

Beside from perfecting my green tea brewing, I enjoy going for a run late at night as well as playing around with Ruby on Rails.

I"m currently looking for summer internship oppurtunities!
