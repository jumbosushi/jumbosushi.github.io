Hi there :wave:

Atsushi here. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com) in the Information Retrieval (IR) Platform team.

Previously I've worked at [Stitch Fix](http://stitchfix.com/), [BlackBerry](https://ca.blackberry.com/), and [Prynt](https://www.prynt.co/).

I live in terminal and love to [configure my Vim](https://github.com/jumbosushi/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)
