Hello hello

I'm Atsushi, and I'm a 2nd year Business and Computer Science student at University of British Columbia.

Beside from perfecting my green tea brewing, I enjoy learning web development and trying out new JavaScript frameworks.

Once you know below facts about me, we're basically best buddies:

- I'm 100% Japanese (konnichiwaaa)
- I have many siblings (and guess who's the youngest)
- I'm currently into eating avocado with soy sauce (believe me, it changed my world)
- If there's an event with free cookies on campus, I will be there (and you should be too)
- I love hackathons! (especially ones with travel reimbursements üòè)

You cool and me cool, so we should definitely connect on Twitter :D
