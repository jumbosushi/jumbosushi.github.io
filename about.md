Hi :wave:

My name is Atsushi, and I'm a 3rd year Business and Computer Science student at University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

I've worked as an intern at [BlackBerry](https://ca.blackberry.com/) and at [Prynt](https://www.prynt.co/) in the past.

Things I enjoy are going late night run as well as [configuring my Vim](https://github.com/jumbosushi/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

I'm currently looking for summer internship oppurtunities!
