Hi there :wave:

Atsushi here. I'm a 3rd year Business and Computer Science student at University of British Columbia.

I've worked as an intern at [BlackBerry](https://ca.blackberry.com/) and at [Prynt](https://www.prynt.co/) in the past.

Outside of classes I helped organize [nwHacks](https://www.nwhacks.io/) and now run community events for [StartupStorm](https://www.startupstorm.org/).

I live in terminal and love to [configure my Vim](https://github.com/jumbosushi/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).
