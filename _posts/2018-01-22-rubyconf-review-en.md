Rubyconf 2017 was happening at New Orleans on Nov 14 - 17, and I was able to attend thanks to Rubyconf's Opportunity Scholar program.
This retrospective is for future scholars who might be interested in the program to learn what it was like, since I couldn't find any info about it when I was applying. Let me just tell you up front that the experience was beyond everything I hoped for and more! Highly recommended.

I almost opted out of the program since missing days of university classes felt like a risky move given that it was before the finals season when assignments were piling up. But this just too good of an opportunity to let go easily. My mind was made up when all the professors that I talked to recommended me to go, so off I went.

The imposter syndrome was very real the day before since I was still a student in a sea of people in the industry. This feeling was instantly mitigated when I met other scholars on the first day. It was nice to meet others

As one start learning about Ruby, the first thing they read is how nice Ruby community is. My experience verifies this.
Everyone I talked to politely told me about themselves, and I found my imposter syndrome going away during the first day.

After getting over it, the whole conference was a fun roller coaster. Got to meet so many people like author of the first Ruby on Rails book I read, another author who's article I was reading only few days ago, and much more. Personally meeting Matz is an incredible honour. The coolest thing happened during lunch on day since I was able to join his table and got to ask all kind of questions

Everything I know I learned from the internet, and there were so many that I used their resource to thank personally was amazing
I was looking forward to meet Japanese rubyists, and did so
Got to meet with Matz, and have a lunch with him
Got to learn all the different ways people use Ruby in their lives

Got to learn a whole lot

Advise:
- I wish I was less intimidated to talk to group of people who knew each other already
- Checkout #rubyconf during the conf. I don't use hashtag too often to realized later that it can be used to find Ruby people before, during, and after the conf. Not just after!
- Talk to more people, they're more willing than I anticipated
- Take time to explore hallway tracks
